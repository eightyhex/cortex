### 2026-03-15 — Task 1.1 ✅
- Implemented CortexConfig with nested Pydantic models for vault, index, embeddings, search, lifecycle, draft, and mcp sections
- YAML loading with settings.yaml → settings.example.yaml fallback via custom pydantic-settings source
- Environment variable overrides work with CORTEX_ prefix and __ nested delimiter
- Files: `src/cortex/config.py`, `tests/test_config.py`
- Tests: 6 tests, all pass (default loading, YAML loading, example fallback, env override, missing file defaults, Path type check)

<!-- Example entry:
